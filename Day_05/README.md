# Day 05: Python Loops and Password Generator

## Overview
This project, developed as part of "The 100 Days of Python" challenge, focuses on Python loops (for loops), the `range()` function, and the `random` module to create a robust password generator.

## Concepts Covered
- For Loops
- Range Function
- Random Module
- Lists
- String Manipulation (joining lists to strings)

## Project: Password Generator
This program generates a strong, random password based on user-defined criteria for the number of letters, numbers, and symbols. Users can also choose whether to randomize the order of characters in the final password.

### How to Use
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter the desired number of characters, numbers, and symbols when prompted.
3. Choose whether you want the generated password to be randomized.
4. The program will generate and display your custom password.
