# Day 02: Tip Calculator

## Overview
This project, developed as part of "The 100 Days of Python" challenge, focuses on Python data types, mathematical operations, and number manipulation to create a practical Tip Calculator.

## Concepts Covered
- Python Primitive Data Types
- Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion
- Mathematical Operations in Python
- Number Manipulation and F Strings in Python

## Project: Tip Calculator
This program calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill with a tip. It takes the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and number of people sharing the bill as inputs.

### How to Use
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Enter the total bill amount when prompted.
3. Enter the tip percentage you'd like to give.
4. Enter the number of people splitting the bill.
5. The program will calculate and display the amount each person should pay.

## Example Interaction
```
