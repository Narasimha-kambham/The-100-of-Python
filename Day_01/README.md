# Day 01: Working with Variables in Python to Manage Data

## Overview
This project, developed as part of "The 100 Days of Python" challenge, focuses on fundamental Python concepts such as variable manipulation, string operations, and user input to create a simple Band Name Generator.

## Concepts Covered
- Printing to the Console in Python
- String Manipulation and Code Intelligence
- The Python Input Function
- Python Variables
- Variable Naming Conventions

## Project: Band Name Generator
This program prompts the user for the city they grew up in and the name of their pet. It then combines these inputs to suggest a unique band name.

### How to Use
1. Run the `main.py` script.
2. Follow the prompts to enter the required information.
3. The program will generate and display a band name.

## Example Interaction
