# Day 06: Python Functions & Karel

## Overview
This project, developed as part of "The 100 Days of Python" challenge, focuses on Python functions, indentation, and while loops to solve programming challenges including escaping a maze.

## Concepts Covered
- Defining and Calling Python Functions
- Indentation in Python
- While Loops
- Escaping the Maze

## Project: Maze Escape
This program demonstrates the use of functions and while loops to navigate through a maze and find the exit.

### How to Use
1. Copy the code from `main.py`.
2. Paste the code into the Reeborg's World challenge window.
3. Run the code in Reeborg's World to see the character navigate the maze.
